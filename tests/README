First lines in the file indicate compiler options and expected output. Valid entries are:

#compiler-options:<command line options>
#compiler-message:<output text>
#exit-code:<code>
#ignore-global-opts

For multiple messages, use multiple #compiler-output lines, one for each expected output.

By default, the options /noconfig and /nologo will be passed to every test in addition to any options
specified in the file. To suppress the automatic inclusion of these options add the #ignore-global-opts

If the test requires any references, place them in the references folder and refer to them as /r:SomeFile.dll
for example as the contents of the references folder will be copied alongside the compiler executable
in the test run folder
